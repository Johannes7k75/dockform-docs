# Filesets

Filesets keep a local directory in sync with a path inside a Docker volume.
They let you manage application config, assets, or seeds declaratively, without baking files into images.

- **Declarative sync**: define the source, target volume, and target path; Dockform syncs diffs only.
- **Idempotent and incremental**: only changed, added, or removed files are applied.
- **Compose-friendly**: attach the target volume to services via Compose as an external volume.
- **Optional service restarts**: list services to restart after files are updated.

## Defining a fileset

A fileset has four required inputs: `source`, `target_volume`, `target_path`, and optional `exclude`/`restart_services`.

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
docker:
  context: default
  identifier: staging

filesets:
  traefik:
    source: traefik/config
    target_volume: traefik_config
    target_path: /etc/traefik
    restart_services:
      - traefik
    exclude:
      - ".git/"
      - "**/.DS_Store"
```

- **source**: local directory path, relative to the manifest file or absolute. Must exist.
- **target_volume**: Docker volume name. If missing, Dockform creates it during `apply`.
- **target_path**: absolute path inside the volume (must start with `/` and cannot be `/`).
- **exclude**: gitignore-like patterns. Directory patterns ending with `/` exclude everything under them.
- **restart_services**: Compose service names to restart when this fileset changes.
- **apply_mode**: how to apply file changes. See [Apply Modes](#apply-modes) below.

## Using with Compose

Attach the fileset’s `target_volume` to services as an external volume.

::: code-group

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
networks:
  traefik: {}
filesets:
  traefik:
    source: traefik/config
    target_volume: traefik_config
    target_path: /etc/traefik
    restart_services:
      - traefik
```

```yaml [app/docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v3
    networks:
      - traefik
    volumes:
      - traefik_config:/etc/traefik

volumes:
  traefik_config:
    external: true
```

## How sync works

Dockform builds a content index from the local source and compares it with a remote index inside the volume at the `target_path`.

- The index is stored at `.dockform-index.json` inside the target path.
- On differences, Dockform:
  - packs created/updated files in a tar and extracts them into the volume, creating parent directories as needed;
  - deletes files that are present remotely but absent locally;
  - writes the new index file.
- If nothing changed (same tree hash), the fileset is skipped.

## Lifecycle and operations

- **plan**: shows file operations per fileset when the Docker client is available; otherwise, shows a generic "planned" note.
- **apply**:
  - Ensures the target volume exists (created via Volumes logic if missing).
  - Computes diffs and syncs changes into the volume.
  - Writes/updates `.dockform-index.json`.
  - Queues `restart_services` for restart after compose changes are applied.
- **destroy**: removes fileset-associated volumes first, then standalone volumes and networks.

Notes:
- Filesets operate on volumes, not bind mounts.
- Multiple filesets can target different volumes and paths.
- Large trees are processed deterministically; paths are sorted for stable archives and hashes.

## Apply Modes

Filesets support two apply modes that control how files are synchronized with running containers:

### Hot Mode (Default)

With `apply_mode: hot` (or when `apply_mode` is not specified), Dockform syncs files while containers are running, then restarts the services listed in `restart_services`.

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
filesets:
  nginx_config:
    source: nginx/conf
    target_volume: nginx_config
    target_path: /etc/nginx
    apply_mode: hot  # Default behavior
    restart_services:
      - nginx
```

**Hot mode workflow:**
1. Sync files to volume (containers keep running)
2. Apply application changes via `docker compose up`
3. Restart services listed in `restart_services`

This is the fastest mode and works well for most applications that can reload configuration without stopping.

### Cold Mode

With `apply_mode: cold`, Dockform stops the services selected as targets, syncs files, then starts those services again.

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
filesets:
  database_config:
    source: postgres/conf
    target_volume: postgres_config
    target_path: /etc/postgresql
    apply_mode: cold
    restart_services:
      - postgres
      - pgbouncer
```

**Cold mode workflow:**
1. Stop target services
2. Sync files to volume
3. Start the previously stopped services

Use cold mode when:
- The application requires files to be updated only when stopped
- File changes could corrupt running processes
- You need atomic file updates across multiple files
- Database configurations or other critical system files need updating

::: tip
Cold mode does nothing if no targets are set (allowed). It only changes the sync contract (no in-place updates while services are running).
:::

### Choosing the Right Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode | Reason |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Web server configs | `hot` | Can reload config via restart |
| Static assets | `hot` | No restart needed, just file sync |
| Database configs | `cold` | Requires clean shutdown/startup |
| SSL certificates | `hot` | Most apps can reload certs |
| Application binaries | `cold` | Files must not change while running |

## Restart targets

The `restart_services` field controls which services Dockform acts on after a fileset sync (for hot) or before/after sync (for cold).

Accepted values:
- A list of service names: `[serviceA, serviceB]`
- The sentinel string: `attached`
- Omitted: no restarts (targets = ∅)

Resolution rules:
- If omitted → targets = ∅ (no-op)
- If list → targets = that list (deduped, order preserved)
- If `attached` → Dockform discovers all services that mount `target_volume` (any path, ro/rw) and uses that set (deduped). If none found, continue without restarts.

Apply flow:
- Hot (default): sync files while services are running; if targets ≠ ∅ then restart targets.
- Cold: if targets = ∅, do not stop/start anything (still valid); else, stop all targets → sync files → start all targets.

## Example: static site assets

::: code-group

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
applications:
  web:
    root: ./web
    project:
      name: web-staging

filesets:
  site:
    source: ./assets
    target_volume: web-assets
    target_path: /usr/share/nginx/html
    restart_services:
      - web
    exclude:
      - ".git/"
      - "**/*.map"

volumes:
  web-assets: {}
```

```yaml [web/docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - web-assets:/usr/share/nginx/html

volumes:
  web-assets:
    external: true
```

:::

- Run `dockform plan` to preview volume creation and fileset changes.
- Run `dockform apply` to sync files, start/update services, and restart any listed services.

## Example: application requiring cold updates

Some applications require that configuration files are only updated when the container is stopped. For example, certain media management tools or databases that lock configuration files:

::: code-group

```yaml [dockform.yaml]
applications:
  media:
    root: ./media

filesets:
  jackett:
    source: jackett/config
    target_volume: jackett_data
    target_path: /config
    apply_mode: cold
    restart_services:
      - jackett
```

```yaml [media/docker-compose.yaml]
services:
  jackett:
    image: linuxserver/jackett
    volumes:
      - jackett_data:/config

volumes:
  jackett_data:
    external: true
```

:::

When you run `dockform apply`:
1. Dockform stops the `jackett` service (target)
2. Syncs configuration files from `jackett/config/` to the volume
3. Starts the `jackett` service
