title: Dockform Volume Snapshot

# `dockform volume snapshot`

Create a snapshot of a Docker volume to local storage

```
dockform volume snapshot <volume> [--output DIR] [--note NOTE]
```

### Description

Snapshots are created by launching a tiny helper container that mounts the volume read-only and streams a `tar` archive back to your machine via stdout. The archive is compressed with `zstd` by default and saved next to your manifest, along with a JSON sidecar containing metadata for validation and restore.

### Flags

```
  -o, --output DIR   Output directory for snapshots (default: ./.dockform/snapshots)
      --note string  Optional note to include in metadata
```

### File layout

```
.dockform/
  snapshots/
    <volume-name>/
      <timestamp>__spec-<8chars>.tar.zst
      <timestamp>__spec-<8chars>.json
```

Where `spec-<8chars>` is a short hash of the volume spec (driver, options, labels) so you can see at a glance which snapshot matches the current desired spec.

### Notes

- Works for local and remote Docker contexts; the stream is returned to your client.
- Uses numeric owners and preserves xattrs/ACLs when available.
