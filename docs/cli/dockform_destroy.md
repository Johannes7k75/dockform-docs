# `dockform destroy`

Destroy all managed resources

### Synopsis

Destroy all resources managed by dockform with the configured identifier.

This command will:
- List all containers, networks, volumes, and filesets labeled with the dockform identifier
- Show a plan of what will be destroyed (same format as 'dockform plan')
- Prompt for confirmation by typing the identifier name
- Destroy resources in the correct order (containers → networks → volumes)

Warning: This operation is irreversible and will destroy ALL managed resources,
regardless of what's in your current configuration file.
